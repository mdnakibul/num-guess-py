# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game generates a random number between a specified range and asks the player to guess the number. The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low, and the goal is to guess the correct number.

---

## Features

- **GUI Interface**: Built using the Tkinter library, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Random Number Generation**: A random number is generated by the program, and the player guesses the number.
- **Feedback**: The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Counter**: Tracks the number of attempts the player has made to guess the number.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Tkinter** (GUI Toolkit)
- **Random** (For random number generation)

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download the repository**.
2. **Install Tkinter** (if it's not already installed):
   - Tkinter is included by default with most Python installations, but if it's missing, you can install it using the following command (for Linux users):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

## Example Game Flow:

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player enters their guess.
- The program provides feedback:
- "Too high" if the guess is above the target number.
- "Too low" if the guess is below the target number.
- "Correct!" if the guess matches the generated number.

### Steps to Customize

1. Replace `number_guessing_game.py` with the name of your Python script if different.
2. If you add more features in the future, update the **Future Enhancements** section to reflect those changes

## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels (e.g., easy, medium, hard) with varying ranges for the random number.
- Include an option to restart the game after the correct number is guessed.
- Add a timer to track how long it takes to guess the correct number.
