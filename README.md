# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game generates a random number between a specified range and asks the player to guess the number. The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low, and the goal is to guess the correct number.
